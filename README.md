# Honeybee Conservation and Preservation through Data Science

## About

Honeybees are vital pollinators in our communities and economies. Hence, it is important that we work to conserve their hives and populations to minimize loss. My research focused on several publicly-available datasets pertaining to honeybees and hive dynamics.  The relationship between different features of hives and varroa mites was analyzed to learn how to predict the level of varroa present in hives using a variety of different statistical methods. The pattern of hive loss from external seasonal trends was also considered and analyzed. The goal of my research was to determine if information about hives can predict overall hive health vis-à-vis varroa prevalence.
